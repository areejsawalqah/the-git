# what is the computer?

Computers are the most complex machines that have ever been created. Very few people
really know how they work. This book will tell you how they work and no technical
knowledge is required. It explains the operation of a simple, but fully functional,
computer in complete detail. The simple computer described consists mainly of a
processor and main memory. Relays, which are explained, are used in the circuitry
instead of transistors for simplicity. This book does not cover peripherals like modems,
mice, disk drives, or monitors.

# How do data and instructions get from an input device into memory?

The control unit sends them. Likewise, when the time is right, the control unit sends these items from memory to the arithmetic/logic unit, where an arithmetic operation or logical operation is performed. After being processed, the information is sent to memory, where it is hold until it is ready to he released to an output unit.

The chief characteristic of memory is that it allows very fast access to instructions and data, no matter where the items are within it. We will discuss the physical components of memory-memory chips-late
